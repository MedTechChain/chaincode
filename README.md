# MedTech Chain Chaincode

Note: The docker-related files are used to run the chaincode as an external service, 
but the current development infrastructure is not currently configured to use external chaincode. 
Please refer to the `tools` repository in order to deploy the chaincode on the infrastructure.

Proto: Make sure to run `scripts/copy-protos.sh` to load the jar containing the device metadata datatypes.
